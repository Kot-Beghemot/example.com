Apple Products and Consumer Laws in the United Kingdom
Under consumer laws in the UK, consumers are entitled to a free of charge repair and (depending on the circumstances) may be entitled to a replacement, discount or refund by the seller, of defective goods or goods which do not conform with the contract of sale. For goods purchased in England or Wales, these rights expire six years from delivery of the goods and for goods purchased in Scotland, these rights expire five years from delivery of the goods.
When you purchase Apple hardware products, you will also receive coverage from the Apple Limited Warranty. This coverage operates alongside and in addition to your statutory rights under UK consumer law. You can also obtain additional benefits by purchasing the optional AppleCare Protection Plan or AppleCare+.
Should your product be defective or if it does not conform with the contract of sale, you can choose to make a claim under UK consumer law, the Apple Limited Warranty or the optional AppleCare Protection Plan or AppleCare+ (whichever is applicable).
Nonâ€“Apple branded products purchased from Apple are also eligible for coverage under UK consumer law, but these are not covered by the Apple Limited Warranty, the AppleCare Protection Plan or AppleCare+.
